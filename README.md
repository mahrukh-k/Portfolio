## **About Me**
Hi! My name is Mahrukh (she/her). I am a second year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing the Public Policy & Data Analytics program at Heinz College. I love working with numbers and have a weird inclination towards making charts whenever I start working on a new dataset. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahrukh-khan/).

## **What I Hope to Learn**
I hope to learn how to make visually appealing infographics through which I can present the data in a meaningful way.
