# Final Project

## Outline
In this project, I aim to highlight the increasing level of food wastage in United States. I have chosen this topic because of the urgency of the matter. The [Sustainable Development Goal # 12](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/) aims to end food wastage by the year 2030. Considering the alarming level of food wastage in United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture set the first domestic [goal of ending food wastage by half by the the year 2030](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/united-states-2030-food-loss-and-waste-reduction-goal#:~:text=The%20goal%20seeks%20to%20cut,money%20for%20families%20and%20businesses.). 

Controlling and reducing food wastage can help reduce malnutrition by redirecting the food to disadvantaged and low-income populations. 

In particular, I will look into three key areas:

* How the trend of food wastage has changed over time
* Which products are categorized as high-wastage products
* At which stage of the food chain is the wastage the highest?

By identifying these aspects of food wastage, I intend to sensitize individuals (food producers, retailers and consumers) on how to reduce their food waste by presenting actionable recommendations.

## Sketches

## Data
I will use the open-source data on food wastage available on [Food Loss and Waste Database](https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-data/en/) by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The dataset contains yearly data from 2000 to 2019 on the quantity of food loss and percentage of food loss for each food category code. In addition, the dataset has information about the food supply stages at which the food loss happened. I will filter the data for United States and aggregate the food loss quantity to identify top food products and supply chain phase that have seen the highest food wastage over the years. 

## Method & Medium
I will use hand-drawn sketches and Figma for the initial sketches. I intend to use both Tableau and Flourish for the visualizations. For the final project, I will use shorthand to present my story and analysis.
