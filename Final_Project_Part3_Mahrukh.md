# Final Project: Part III

## Summary of Changes:
When I started working on this project in Part I, the idea was too broad because I was focusing on food waste globally, in United States, in different sectors, and in households. I received feedback that it should be narrowed down further. In Part II, I changed the focus only to households and modified my call to action accordingly. The first set of feedback I recieved in Part-2 from the User Research helped me improve some of the elements of the visuals. The interviews were also helpful in removing content that was distracting. Following the interviews, in-class discussion and the Teaching Team's feedback, I made the following changes to my story:

**Changes to Visuals:

First, I enlarged all visuals by making them in a Tableau Dashboard. This also allowed me to add the Source of data in a text box below the visual. Second, I made the titles bigger (in bold and colored) and also changed the phrasing of all titles; instead of describing what the chart is about, I wrote the key message of the visual in the title. For example, the area chart now reads "In 2019, a total of 21 million tons of food waste was attributed to households in United States" which was previously "Food waste across sectors".

I also got feedback to highlight Residential sector in the area chart to bring focus so I changed the color palette and chose the darkest shade of red for Residential category. Previously the colors were blue/green which I realized were not going well with the overall color theme of fruits/food items. I also changed the color palette for the tree map to match the color theme in the banner that comes right before it (picture of red,yellow,green bell peppers).

For the impact of food wastage, my User Research showed that both the visuals were confusing and I removed both and created new visuals. I dropped the donut chart on the different categories of greenhouse gases coming from food waste and replaced it with a simple animated line chart showing how the food waste in landfills has sharply increased over time along with the text on the left saying that waste disposal produces greenhouse gases. I also dropped the bar chart showing food donations because the interviees couldn't understand how it links to food insecurity. So instead, I made a donut chart showing the percentage of food insecure households in United States. 

I also got feedback on presenting the 59 kg food waste in the form of burgers. I did not find a right place to add it because this information is in a banner. But this feedback made me think that I could perhaps present the first statistic on "one-third of all food is wasted" as a pictorial so I added that in the first frame. I used Infogram to create the pictorial. 

**Changes to Shorthand layout:

Previously, I was starting my story with the Sustainable Development Goal. But I thought viewers might need more context on why it is important after all. So, in the first frame of the story on Shorthand, I added a key statistic "one-third of all food produced in the world is wasted" to set the context before giving more information about the Sustainable Development Goal and U.S. domestic goal of reducing food waste.

I also added a banner showing the total food wasted by an average person in United States (kg/capita/year) to make it pop. Previously this information was presented as world map which was not serving the purpose because I realized that the audience might focus on the darkest region of that map (a country in Africa) instead of focusing on U.S. so I removed it. I received feedback to present this statistic in pounds which I did. 

In the frame where I use "Scrollmation", I removed the previous icons and used better icons from the Noun Project. However, these are black/white and do not go with the theme overall because I was not able to get colored icons available for public use. 

I also received feedback on separating the two impacts of food waste (greenhouse gases and food insecurity) into different frames. Previously I had both of these in the same frame which was a lot of information to digest at first sight. I added two new frames, one for each impact, and created new charts (animated line chart and donut chart) that were easier to understand (described above).

In the call to action, I had originally created different frames for each Action item but I received feedback to make the font bigger and center-align it with the images so I changed these frames accordingly. Finally, to make the Call to Action relevant for my presentation audience, I added a link to 412 Food Rescue, an organization operating in Pittsburgh that collects excess food and distributes it to those in need.
