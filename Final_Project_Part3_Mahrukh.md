My final data story is available on [Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/rotten-potatoes/index.html)

## Summary of Changes:
- separated call to action into 4 different frames with bigger font size and a different screen layout
- added 412 food rescue

The first set of feedback I recieved in Part-2 from the User Research helped me improve some of the elements of the visuals and were also helpful in removing content that was distracting. Following the interviews, in-class discussion and the Teaching Team's feedback, I made the following changes to my story and visuals:

**Changes to Visuals:

First, I enlarged all visuals by making them in a Tableau Dashboard. This also allowed me to add the Source of data in a text box below the visual. 

Second, I made the titles bigger and also changed the phrasing of all titles; instead of describing what the chart is about, I wrote the key message of the visual in the title which was short and easy to remember. For example, the area chart now reads "In 2019, a total of 21 million tons of food waste was attributed to households in United States". 

I also got feedback to highlight Residential sector in the area chart to bring focus so I changedthe color palette and chose the darkest shade of red for Residential category. I changed the color palette for the tree map showing food products wasted the most to match the color scheme in the banner that comes right before it (picture of red,yellow,green bell peppers).

For the impact of food wastage, my User Research showed that the visuals were confusing. I dropped the donut chart on the different categories of greenhouse gases coming from food waste and made a simple animated line chart showing how the food waste in landfills has sharply increased over time. I also dropped the bar chart showing food donations because the interviees found it hard to understand how it links to food insecurity. So instead, I made a donut chart showing the percentage of food insecure households in United States. 

**Changes to Shorthand layout:

In the first frame of the story on Shorthand, I added a key statistic "one-third of all food produced in the world is wasted" to set the context before giving more information about the Sustainable Development Goal and U.S. domestic goal of reducing food waste.

I also added a banner showing the total food wasted by an average person in United States (kg/capita/year) to make it pop. Previously this information was presented as world map which was not serving the purpose because I realized that the audience might focus on the darkest region of that chart (a country in Africa) instead of focusing on U.S. so I removed it. I received feedback to add the waste in pounds which I did. 

In the frame where I use "Scrollmation", I removed the previous icons and used better icons from the Noun Project. However, these are black/white and do not go with the theme overall because I was not able to get colored icons available for public use. 

I also received feedback on separating the two impacts of food waste (greenhouse gases and food insecurity) into different frames. Previously I had both of these in the same frame which was a lot of information to digest at first sight. I added two new frames, one for each impact, and created new charts that were easier to understand (described above).

In the call to action, I had originally created different frames for each Action item but I received feedback to make the font bigger and center-align it with the images so I changed these frames accordingly. Finally, to make the Call to Action relevant for my presentation audience, I added a link to 412 Food Rescue, an organization operating in Pittsburgh that collects excess food and distributes it to those in need.
