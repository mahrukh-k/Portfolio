## Summary of Changes:

- changed color palette for tree map to match with previous banner/food colors
- for scrollmation, used images from Noun Project and increased font size
- separate the two impacts into different frames 
- removed pie chart for total emissions and instead added the animated line chart for food waste
- removed bar chart for food donations and added a donut chart to show food insecurity to make a more direct message
- separated call to action into 4 different frames with bigger font size and a different screen layout
- added 412 food rescue

The first set of feedback I recieved in Part-2 from the User Research helped me improve some of the elements of the visuals and were also helpful in removing content that was distracting. Following the interviews, in-class discussion and the Teaching Team's feedback, I made the following changes to my story and visuals:

First, I enlarged all visuals by making them in a Tableau Dashboard. This also allowed me to add the Source of data in a text box below the visual. Second, I made the titles bigger and also changed the phrasing of all titles; instead of describing what the chart is about, I wrote the key message of the visual in the title which was short and easy to remember. For example, the area chart now reads "In 2019, a total of 21 million tons of food waste was attributed to households in United States". I also added a banner right in the beginning showing the total food wasted by an average person in United States (kg/capita/year). I received feedback to add the waste in pounds which I did. Here, I previously had a world map showing the food waste (kg/capita/year) across the globe but I realized that the audience might focus on the darkest region of that chart (a country in Africa) instead of focusing on U.S. so I removed it.
