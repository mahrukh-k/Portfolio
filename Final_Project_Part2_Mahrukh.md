## Wireframe
I have developed an initial wireframe of the project on [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/qHdqBbjv1jsUFWFh). 

## User Research

### Interviews
For the user research, I interviewed three people. The purpose of my research was to understand the elements of my story that they can recall. I asked additional questions on the visuals and the positioning of 



Question  | Interviewee-1 <br /> Male, Age late 30s, semi-technical background | Interviewee-2 <br /> Female, Age early 20s, technical background | Interviewee-3 <br />  Female, Age early 30s, non-technical background |
|:--------- |:-----------|:-----------|:------------|
What got your attention? | The food products that are wasted the most by households. | The 59 kg of waste per person. I think that is a lot.| Graphics and use of color is eye catching. It draws attention towards the stats that are imp to know in this doc. |
Describe what this is telling you | Information on food waste around the world  | The page is presenting  information on food waste, concentrated in geographical areas, and presenting solutions for individuals to contribute towards avoiding food wastage. | Data on food wastage in the world and the US, its impact on the environment and ways to reduce it. |
Any comments on the color palette, font, and positioning of text or images? | The font looks small relative to the charts. I don't see any specific color palette being used. | The title of the charts are small and colored grey which makes it hard to read.  | I like the use of color. One thing that I didn't quite understand was the spectrum on some pages. Did not get what it represents so naybe a line about it would be beneficial for a lay person. Also, the world map may not be mobile friendly. I had to open the link or download to access it in full and that might be a turn off for some people. |
Anything surprising or confusing? | food waste per household chart is confusing because it is showing global wastage but the focus here is on U.S. The transition between food waste and donations | average food loss per person seems to be too high. | The graphic that shows how food is wasted at every stage was interesting and interactive |
Who do you think is the intended audience? | Households | Consumers and policy makers | the report seems like it is written for a lay person   in the US to communicate food wastage in very basic and fundamental terms |
Anything you would change? | Change the title of the donations chart. Make the household wastage global chart to U.S. map. | Make the text bigger. Center the text with the images on the side. Bold the titles of visuals. Add colors to the icons; the rest of the page is very colorful and a suddent shift to black/white looks odd. Split the 'why do we care' section into two different sections; right now there is too much information on the same page which is hard to digest. | as an editor I'd do a bit of copy editing. Also I didn't really understand what the significance of "rotten potatoes" was. You're talking about food in general but the title and graphic makes it seem like you're talking specifically about potatoes. |
Any other comments? | Transitions to negative impact should be more elaborative.  | Ending is abrupt. Can have a more impactful conclusion. | The sub heading should also be food wastage instead of food waste |


### In-Class Exercise
Question | Comments |
:--------- |:-----------|
What worked | The first banner saying 'rotten potatoes' is eye-catching. Charts are easy to understand but could be enlarged to improve readability |
What didn't work | You should try a simple donut/pie chart for total emissions by food waste instead of having different types of emissions. Comparing it with emissions from other another industry might be interesting. Try a comparison chart showing total food waste as a very big icon and the donations as a very small icon. Make the charts bigger. |
What questions came up? | Do the readers want to know how much of each pollutant is released by burning food waste? If not, then just present total pollutants. |
What new inspiration arose? | You might want to add a fourth point to the call to action on donating food. Food banks such as 412 Food Rescue in Pittsburgh is one relevant organization. |

## Summary of User Feedback
It seems that all interviewees got the key message which is to reduce food wastage at the consumer level. Almost all interviewees said that charts should be made bigger and titles should be in bold to improve readability. The orientation of charts and text for the 'impact' section appears to be confusing. None of the interviewees were able to understand the visual on food donations and how it relates to the main message. 

## Planned modifications for next iteration
* Enlarge visuals.
* Bold the title of visuals made on Tableau.
* Center align the text next to the visuals.
* Split the 'why do we care' section into two sections - one for impact on environment and one for impact on food insecurity.
* Add colors to the icons showing food waste at the farm, retail, and house level.
* Change title of food donations chart.
* Try to change the food donations chart to a comparison chart showing total food waste as a big icon and total donations as a very small icon.
* Change the food waste emissions chart to present only total emissions.
* Make Tableau charts in Tableau dashboard and add footnote for data source. 
* Add text and details in the 'call to action'.
