_**Description**_
The bubble chart above shows the GDP to Debt Ratio for different countries over time. The slider can be used to change the Year value from 1995 to 2021. 

**Different Methods of Visualization**
The first visualization is a bar chart showing the GDP to Debt Ratio for different countries. This chart is suitable in this case because we are only presenting data for one year i.e. 2021. Additionally, the chart should include a legend explaining the choice of colors which might not be apparent to all readers. 

The second visualization is a grid line chart showing the GDP to Debt Ratio for different countries over time. Each section in the grid is dedicated to data for one country. A line chart is suitable in this scenario because we are presenting the ratio over time. 

For the the third data visualization, I have used a bubble chart to display the GDP to Debt Ratio for different countries over time. The bubble chart helps to display the size of the variable of importance i.e. GDP to Debt Ratio adequately; a smaller bubble represents a lower ratio and a larger bubble represents a higher ratio. I have used a color palette of "Reds" that goes from light orange to red. I choose this color because a higher GDP to Debt Ratio is an alarming situation and a red color is suitable in this context. The color scale also goes from light orange (lower ratio) to dark red (higher ratio) according to general convention. Furthermore, I have added a time slider to show how the ratio changes over time. This feature has helped in making the chart more clear because adding Year within the same chart would have made the chart look more busy.
